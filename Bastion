bastion hosts acts as jump server to connect to to the servers which hosted in a private subnet.

in AWS we can create a instance in a public subnet to make use of bastion service.

launch a instance in public subnet first for bastion.

launch a private instance in private subnet

now in bastion server create a new file using vi editor and add the content of private instance key-pair pem file.
ex: vi testserver.pem

Provide the permission to file using ch command

Chmod 400 test-server.pem

Run the below to command to connect to instance
 
Ssh ec2-user@$privateip$ -i testserver.pem

note: this is amazon linux machine if you are using ubuntu you should mention ubuntu instead of ec2-user.
